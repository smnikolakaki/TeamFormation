In high school, I watched as she took on our male-dominated robotics team, and year after year, climbed higher and higher in the ranks to become team captain. As her literature loving, tech-phobic sister, I didn't really know went on in those robotics team meetings. But one day, I went down to the lab so I could wait to go home with her, and what I saw shocked me. There was something incredibly infuriating about watching her teammates casually brush her ideas aside, choose to ask each other questions when they ran into trouble, were just generally dismissive and rude. Frankly, it pissed me off. My sister is one of the most brilliant (and humble!) human beings I've ever met; she's the left brain to my right brain. I was so frustrated how few girls there were on the team, how there was no one to advocate for my sister, to build her up and tell those guys that, hey, maybe you should actually listen for a second.

Now, I've realized something: I am, in a way, part of the problem. Somehow, I have let years of conditioning tell me that I am not good enough, that I just don't have the brain for coding, or math, or science. But I'm tired of feeling like I can't do it. Yes, I am an English major; yes, literature is my first love. But I would like to give this tech thing a try. I don't think I'll do anything, like, revolutionary.

Since the net was already built when I joined the project, I missed the fundamentals in the implementation of a neural network model (I'm a bit of a beginner!). I'd like to learn from the ground up how to implement these models in any programming language, or even just to understand how code matches up to the theoretical explanation of the model.

Additionally, I'd like to see the different perspective on machine learning, since my project is very specific to its field of research. I feel this will give me broader insight into machine learning, where it's headed, and its various potential applications now; this fundamental view will help me see my own project from a higher level.

As an aside, even though I chose machine learning as the technology I'd like to focus on, I wish I could've chose multiple! Web development is a very interesting topic to me as well; I've always wanted to be able to build my own website.","Throughout my college career as a female engineer, I've gotten used to having mostly male friends and being one of few girls in my classes.

And sometimes, there are times that these things do catch up to me. Just yesterday, I attended a career fair for the computer science & engineering students at BU, and was immediately overwhelmed by the imbalance between male and female students. I felt self-conscious, like I was completely out of place among my own peers and companies I dream of working for. It made me realize that although BU has done a great job of making me feel like I belong here as a female engineer, the real world may not always be that way.

Coding is such a huge part of engineering, and it would really help me to familiarize myself with coding to succeed in my engineering classes. Currently, I'm part of a class design team that is trying to build a prototype for a flood detector system, and coding is a crucial part of the project. I would love to be able to contribute to this aspect of the design process, as even gaining more of an understanding about coding can help me brainstorm ways in which the device could function, even if I don't do the actual coding myself. Lastly, from the basic MATLAB that I can do, I know that coding can serve as a way to solve problems effectively and efficiently. For instance, in my Systems Physiology lab, I use MATLAB for data analysis and representation to better understand the material, so I would love to gain more exposure to widely used coding languages as I go deeper into the biomedical engineering field.","For as long as I can remember, I've been compared to my STEM-minded older brother.

If that was the case, my brother and I would have received the same reactions.
